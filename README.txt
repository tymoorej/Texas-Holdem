Description of the project:
We coded a Texas Holdem Poker game. This game is a variation of the card
game of poker. Two cards are dealt face down to each player and the five table
cards are dealt face up in three stages. The three stages include three cards,
followed by one card and followed by the last card. Betting takes place after
each round. Players have betting options to check, call, raise, bet or fold.
Our game is designed to be allow for one player to play against the computer!
The bot decides what kind of moves it plays based on the Monte Carlo algorithm,
it calculates its chance of winning each game. According to its chance, it will
make a move. All the pictures used in this game are collected online and the
links to the pictures are provided in a document called “sources.txt”


How to run it:
In order to run it go to the folder containing all the files, in the command
line type “python3 main.py” in order to run the game. If you are curious to know
the run times for the functions, you can type “python3 main.py -p” this will run
the profiler and will print run times onto the terminal.
